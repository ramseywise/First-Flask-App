# First-Flask-App

I developed a built-in API server with Flask custom made for my fearless leader, Grainnoush. It returns random Rammoush sayings from a list and matches it with cute cat photos. I used a random choice model for version 1 as I did not have any training data. Version 2 aims to include tracking information from users in order to develop a fully fledged cat meme recommending system.
