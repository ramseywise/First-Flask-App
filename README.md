# First-Flask-App

This is a simple Flask-based, custom-designed app with a built-in API server designed for my fearless leader, Grainnoush. It returns random Rammoush sayings from a list and matches it with cute cat photos. I used a random choice model for Version 1 as I did not have any training data. Version 2 aims to include semantic analysis and tracking information from users in order to develop a fully fledged cat meme recommending system.

## Features

- Flask web-interface integration 
- Python micro-service setup and design
- API embedding (eg youtube, randomcatgenerator, googleimagesdownload)
- UI interactive design with image and video embeddedings
- HTML templates and requests
- Virtualenv
